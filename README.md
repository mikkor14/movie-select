# Movie Group Select 

The first demo for my MovieGroup Select project. The idea behind the app is to help groups
of people to find a movie to watch together! The final version of the app will take in data in form of genre preferences on a scale from 0 to 10. It then combines input from every user and searches though a database of movies to find the closest value to an average genre preference from all users. 

## Planned Functionality
- Allow users to specify how many people the app will be taking input from
- More effective search/score calc algorithm
- More filters for users like min score on IMDB or age limit
- Integration with the IMDB and RottenTomatoes API's
- Database integration

## Changelog
- 01.03.2019 (Alpha 1.0) - First demo version of the app. Allows input from 3 users and a a hardcoded database of 10 of some of my favorite movies. At the moment you have to reload the page after every find due to a bug where the score values persist when you change the values. Will fix in the next version
